1) Renaming files : mv statstics.txt statistics.txt

2) Moving and Copying: proteins-saved.dat recombine

3) Listing Directories and Files: 
      mv fructose.dat analyzed
      mv sucrose.dat analyzed

4) Copy with Multiple Filenames
  What does cp do when given several filenames and a directory name, as in:
  $ cp thesis/citations.txt thesis/quotations.txt backup
  
  Answer: Moves both the files to the directory
  
  What does cp do when given three or more filenames, as in:
  
  Answer : Throws an error message 
      cp: target ‘c.text’ is not a directory
      
5) Listing Recursively and By Time: Lists it recursively and according to time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What does sort -n do?
  the -n flag to specify that the sort is numerical instead of alphabetical.

2) use < to redirect its input, i.e., to read from a file instead of from standard input. 
For example, instead of writing wc mydata.dat, we could write wc < mydata.dat. 
In the first case, wc gets a command line parameter telling it what file to open. 
In the second, wc doesn’t have any command line parameters, so it reads from standard input, 
but we have told the shell to send the contents of mydata.dat to wc‘s standard input.

3) wc -l * | sort -n | head -3

4) Why do you think uniq only removes adjacent duplicated lines? (Hint: think about very large data sets.) 
    sometimes they could be duplicate postings if they occur continuously. Whereas if there is another different character 
    between them then it has to be counted as another occurance. 

    >> sort uniq.txt | uniq 
    
5) Pipe reading comprehension
      2012-11-06,rabbit
      2012-11-06,deer
      2012-11-05,raccoon
      
6) cut -d , -f 2 uniq.txt | sort | uniq

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loops


1) Variables in loops: 
            fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat
            fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat
            fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat

2) for datafile in *.dat
      do
            ls $datafile
      done
      
      >>    fructose.dat    glucose.dat   sucrose.dat
      
3) Prints fructose.dat, glucose.dat, and sucrose.dat, and copies sucrose.dat to create xylose.dat.

4) All of the text from fructose.dat, glucose.dat and sucrose.dat would be concatenated and saved to a file called sugar.dat.

5) use echo

6) What is the difference between the the two loops below, and which one would we want to run?:
      the second one. because the first one will execute the commands.

Shell Concepts Introduced

1) option 3 : grep -w of haiku.txt

2) Count the number of files in the current working directory with the .dat extension and then display the number of files

3) None of the above.

4) for data in "jo" "beth" "meg" "amy"; do grep -o $data a.txt| sort wc -w ; done
