Question )


difference between local repository and remote repository ?

By executing the git clone command you created a local copy on india of the remote repository hosted on the GitHub server. At this point there are two repositories: local and remote (also known as origin).

ANY changes added via git commit are only committed to the local repository. These changes are NOT YET present at the remote git repos.

to share your commits we must use git push
The first part is git push, meaning that we are telling git to share our local changes with a remote repository.
